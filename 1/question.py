"""
Write a program which asks the user to input a number, and then prints lines of "*" starting with
1 increasing up to the number, and then back to 1

for example:
Please enter a number:
7
*
**
***
****
*****
******
*******
******
*****
****
***
**
*

For this you will need to use `input`:
```
x = input("please enter a value")
```

You will also need to use a loop e.g.:
```
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```
